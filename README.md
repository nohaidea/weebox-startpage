# weebox-startpage
> **_weebox,** _n_. a simple weeb startpage with HTML, Javascript and CSS, inspired by someone's startpage posted in a comment on reddit. 

> if you can't find it, make it yourself.

original inspiration can be found [here](https://voxie12.github.io/moon/).

for firefox based browsers, you can follow [this guide on reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/startpages/comments/g3qndt/psa_how_to_set_a_custom_new_tab_page_in_firefox/) to make your own custom new tab, and be able to run this locally.

for chromium users, just add the path to the file in the "New tab page" option (varies depending on browsers)

if you'd like to activate the time and date, remove the commenting out characters (<!--) in the "index.html"   

you can also host the page directly from [my github website](https://nohaidea.github.io/weebox-startpage/).
